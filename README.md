I am skilled at strong back-end systems with .NET and ASP.NET and equally adept at developing user-friendly front ends using React and Angular. My approach is agile, allowing me to quickly adapt and incorporate user feedback. In my work, I frequently use Microsoft SQL Server and Azure to boost performance and create scalable solutions that meet the needs of users. I'm always keen on learning the newest trends in Microsoft Technologies, React, and Angular. I take great care in crafting accessible and responsive interfaces, ensuring I follow the best practices in version control, documentation, and testing.
